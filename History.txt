Windows CE VNC viewer history
=============================

3.3.2 Initial Release
---------------------
Quick port from Win32 version.  Fairly crude replacement of C++ exceptions with SEH - 
may well be problems with certain destructors not being called..

Doesn't support palettes yet.

Should be changed to only request update area displayed.
